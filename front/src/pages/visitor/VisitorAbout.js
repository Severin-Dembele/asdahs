                              You are being asked to participate in a study about health and health behaviors by answering a questionnaire. The information you give may help African Seventh-day Adventists be healthier and get better health education. There are no identifiable risks to you for participating. The questionnaire is anonymous, and your identity will not be revealed. Do not write your name on the questionnaire.
                          </p>
                          <p class="mb-4">
                              You will not be paid to participate. Your participation is voluntary. Your answers cannot identify you, so please answer every question as honestly as possible. Finishing the questionnaire should take about an hour or a little more. After the completed questionnaires are returned, they will be kept in a locked office at the Adventist University of Africa in Nairobi, Kenya. When the research is completed, the questionnaires will be destroyed.
                          </p>
